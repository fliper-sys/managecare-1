- **`/businesses/{id}/inventory`**: Inventory quantities

**Field Names**: `quantity` or `stock` (service handles both)

### Low-Stock Detection Logic
```dart
// Service merges both collections and reads quantity/stock
final lowStockProducts = await detectLowStockProducts(
  businessId: 'biz123',
  threshold: 10, // Alert when quantity <= 10
);

// Stream for real-time updates
lowStockService.streamLowStockProducts(businessId)
  .listen((products) {
    // Update UI with current low-stock items
  });
```

### Example Use Cases
- **Pharmacy**: Alert when medicine stock < 20 units
- **Retail**: Notify when popular items drop below reorder point
- **Restaurant**: Alert when ingredient stock critically low
- **Agriculture**: Monitor livestock feed inventory

### Printer Manager Architecture
```
ThermalPrinterManager (facade)
  ├── WebPrinterImpl (web platform)
  └── AndroidPrinterImpl (Android platform)
      ├── Connection monitoring (5s timer)
      ├── Auto-reconnection (3s delay, exponential backoff)
      └── Raw byte transmission (chunked, delayed)
```

### Printer Status Enum
```dart
enum PrinterStatus {
  connected,      // Ready to print
  disconnected,   // Not connected
  printing,       // Actively printing
  error,          // Error state
  unknown,        // Status unknown
}
```

### Connection Flow
1. **Discover**: Scan for paired Bluetooth devices
2. **Select**: User chooses printer from list
3. **Connect**: Establish BLE connection
4. **Monitor**: Start periodic connection checks
5. **Print**: Send ESC/POS bytes in chunks
6. **Verify**: Status stream confirms success

### Status Stream for Diagnostics
```dart
final manager = ThermalPrinterManager();

// Subscribe to status changes (for logging/debugging)
manager.onStatusChanged.listen((status) {
  print('Printer status: $status');
});

// Status changes emit with timestamps:
// [2026-01-29T14:32:15.123Z] Status changed -> connected
// [2026-01-29T14:32:20.456Z] connectionStatus check: true
// [2026-01-29T14:32:25.789Z] Sending 256 bytes...
```

### Usage Example
```dart
final service = ThermalPrintingService();
await service.initialize();

// Discover printers
final printers = await service.getAvailablePrinters();

// Connect
final connected = await service.connectToPrinter(printers.first);

// Print receipt
final success = await service.printFullReceipt(
  businessName: 'Shop Name',
  receiptNumber: 'RCP-001',
  // ... other details
);

// Test connection
final testResult = await service.testPrinterConnection();
```

### Disconnect Compatibility
The manager handles both `disconnect()` method and `disconnect` getter forms for compatibility:
```dart
// Tries both forms
await PrintBluetoothThermal.disconnect();  // method
await PrintBluetoothThermal.disconnect;    // getter
```
