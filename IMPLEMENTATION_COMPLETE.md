## Code Structure

### PostSaleActionSheet Widget
- Imported in `ReceiptManager.handlePostSale()`
- Shows 3 action buttons: Share, Email, Print
- Displays status messages with color feedback
- Handles Pro-gating and permissions
- Closes when user taps "Done"

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter analyze  # Should show only warnings about unused variables
flutter test    # Run existing tests
```

### 2. Update Version
```
pubspec.yaml: version: x.y.z+build
```

### 3. Build APK/IPA
```bash
# Android
flutter build apk --release

# iOS
flutter build ios --release
```

### 4. Test on Devices
- Test receipt actions on Android physical device
- Test receipt actions on iOS physical device
- Test printer connection (requires real printer or simulator)

### 5. Deploy to Stores
- Upload to Google Play
- Upload to Apple App Store
- Update release notes

## User Communication

### For End Users
1. **New Feature**: "You can now share, email, or print receipts directly after sales!"
2. **Printer Setup**: "Configure your Bluetooth thermal printer in Settings for automatic printing"
3. **Pro Feature**: "Email receipts directly to customers (Pro-only feature)"

### Setup Instructions
- Share `PRINTER_SETUP_GUIDE.md` with customers
- Create tutorial video showing:
  - Pairing printer
  - Scanning in app
  - Test printing
  - Using action sheet buttons

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Bluetooth Device Discovery**: Currently returns mock data for testing
   - **Fix**: Implement actual `blue_thermal_printer` discovery API

2. **Single Printer Per Business**: Only one primary printer configured
   - **Fix**: Support multiple printers with selection menu

3. **No Receipt History**: Receipts not archived
   - **Fix**: Save to Firestore, add receipt history screen

4. **Test Print Only**: Can't print custom text easily
   - **Fix**: Allow ad-hoc text printing from settings

5. **No Batch Printing**: Can't print multiple receipts
   - **Fix**: Add batch print feature for end-of-day reports

---

## Performance Notes

- **Action Sheet**: Negligible overhead (local modal)
- **Printer Scanning**: 2-3 second delay (acceptable UX)
- **Test Print**: 2-5 seconds depending on printer
- **Settings Save**: Immediate local update, background Firestore sync

---

## Security Considerations

- **Permissions**: Requested only when needed (runtime)
- **Bluetooth Data**: Unencrypted but only contains receipt data (public)
- **Email Sending**: Requires server validation of receipts
- **Pro Gating**: Checked client-side and server-side

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "No printer found"
- **Solution**: Verify printer is in pairing mode in device Bluetooth settings

**Issue**: "Connection test failed"
- **Solution**: Restart printer, check paper, ensure Bluetooth is on

**Issue**: "Bluetooth permission denied"
- **Solution**: Go to App Settings > Permissions > Enable Bluetooth

**Issue**: "Email receipts show Pro feature message"
- **Solution**: User needs Professional or Enterprise subscription

**Issue**: "Receipt won't print"
- **Solution**: Re-run connection test, check printer has paper

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Device Discovery**: Remove mock data, use actual API
2. **Multiple Printers**: Support switching between printers
3. **Receipt Templates**: Custom receipt layouts per business
4. **Scheduled Printing**: Print reports on schedule
5. **Printer Diagnostics**: Check ink levels, paper status
6. **Printer Library**: Save favorite receipts
