# Bluetooth Printer - Efficiency Fix & Error Resolution

**Date**: January 17, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Problem Summary

Bluetooth printing on the post-sale action sheet was failing with errors due to:

1. **Convoluted Flow**: Mixed permission requests, connection checks, and device selection
2. **Redundant Code**: Multiple paths doing the same thing
3. **Poor Error Messages**: Generic error messages without helpful guidance
4. **No Fallback Logic**: When one approach failed, whole operation failed
5. **Inefficient Connection Testing**: Testing connection multiple times
6. **Missing Printer Discovery**: Not properly discovering available printers

---

## Solution Overview

### Refactored Print Flow

The `_printReceipt()` method now:
1. ✅ Requests permissions once (at start, not scattered throughout)
2. ✅ Determines connection type (Bluetooth/USB)
3. ✅ Delegates to specific handler methods
4. ✅ Clean separation of concerns
5. ✅ Better error context and recovery

### New Architecture

```
_printReceipt()
├── Request permissions (once)
├── Determine connection type
├── Delegate to handler
└── Error handling wrapper
    ├── _handleWebUsbPrint()
    │   ├── Check WebUSB availability
    │   ├── Get or request device
    │   ├── Send to USB
    │   └── Handle errors
    │
    └── _handleBluetoothPrint()
        ├── Get printer MAC
        ├── Discover printers
        ├── Test connection
        ├── Print receipt
        └── Handle errors
```

---

## Key Changes

### 1. Separated Concerns

**Before**: One massive `_printReceipt()` method with 400+ lines mixing:
- Permissions
- PDF generation
- Web USB
- USB printing
- Bluetooth printing

**After**: Three focused methods:
- `_printReceipt()` - Main orchestrator (100 lines)
- `_handleWebUsbPrint()` - Web USB printer logic (70 lines)
- `_handleBluetoothPrint()` - Bluetooth printer logic (90 lines)

### 2. Cleaner Permission Handling

**Before**:
```dart
final bluetoothConnect = await Permission.bluetoothConnect.request();
final bluetoothScan = await Permission.bluetoothScan.request();
await Permission.location.request();

if (!bluetoothConnect.isGranted || !bluetoothScan.isGranted) {
  // Show error
  return;
}
// But also need to check again later...
```

**After**:
```dart
if (!kIsWeb) {
  final permsOk = await ThermalPrinterService.ensureBluetoothPermissions();
  if (!permsOk) {
    // Show error
    return;
  }
}
// Done - no need to check again
```

### 3. Better Error Messages

**Before**:
```
"Print failed - Ensure printer is powered on and pairing is active"
```

**After**:
```
// Permission issue:
"Bluetooth permissions denied. Please grant in settings."

// No printer found:
"No Bluetooth printer found. Pair a printer first."

// Connection issue:
"Cannot reach printer. Power on & check pairing."

// Print issue:
"Print failed. Check printer power & connection."

// USB issue:
"WebUSB not supported in this browser. Use Chrome/Edge."
```

### 4. Efficient Device Discovery

**Before**:
- Checked settings
- Checked business settings (nested)
- Discovered devices
- Tested connection
- Listed devices again
- Showed picker

**After**:
- Check settings (once)
- Discover devices (once)
- Show picker if multiple (optional)
- Test connection (once)
- Print

## Bluetooth Printer Flow

### Step 1: Initial Setup
```
Check for saved printer MAC
  ↓
Found? → Use it
Not found? → Scan for available printers
```

### Step 2: Printer Selection
```
Found multiple printers?
  ↓
Yes → Show selection dialog
No  → Use found printer
```

### Step 3: Connection Test
```
Can connect to selected printer?
  ↓
Yes → Proceed to print
No  → Show error, don't continue
```

### Step 4: Print Receipt
```
Send receipt to printer
  ↓
Success? → Show success message
Failure? → Show error with context
```

- [ ] Complete a sale
- [ ] Click print receipt
- [ ] Verify receipt prints

### Error Scenarios

**No Printer Selected**:
- [ ] Unpair all printers
- [ ] Try to print
- [ ] Should scan and find printer
- [ ] Verify prints

**Printer Off**:
- [ ] Turn off Bluetooth printer
- [ ] Try to print
