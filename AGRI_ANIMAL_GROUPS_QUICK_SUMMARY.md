## 🔧 Quick Start: Using Animal Groups

### Create a Group
```dart

2. Tap card → Detail screen
3. Tap "Record Feed"
4. Select feed type (starter/grower/layer/maint)
5. Enter kg amount
6. Optional: link inventory product
7. Tap Save → appears in Feed Records tab
```

### Track Eggs (Poultry)
```dart
1. For poultry groups only
2. Detail screen → Tap "Record Eggs"
3. Enter count and date
4. Tap Save
5. Track in Egg Records tab

```

### Search Groups

## 📊 Data Model Reference

### AnimalGroup Fields
```dart
String id                              // Unique identifier
String type                            // poultry|cattle|sheep|goats|pigs|rabbits|fish|bees|horses
String name                            // Custom group name
int count                              // Current animal count
int ageWeeks                           // Current age in weeks
int maturityWeek                       // Age when mature
int feedPerAnimalGrams                 // Daily feed per animal (grams)
String emoji                           // 🐔🐄🐑 etc.

List<EggRecord> eggRecords            // [count, date]
List<Map> feedRecords                 // [feedType, kgAmount, date, productName?]
List<Map> healthRecords               // [eventType, description, date]

DateTime createdAt                     // When group created
DateTime updatedAt                     // Last modified
```

### Key Methods
```dart
// Calculate daily feed need
double dailyFeed = group.calculateDailyFeedKg('grower');

// Get emoji for type
String emoji = AnimalGroup.getEmojiForType('poultry');  // Returns 🐔

// Add record (called by dialogs)
group.addFeedRecord('grower', 25.5, 'Layer Feed');
group.addHealthRecord('vaccination', 'Annual shot', DateTime.now());
```

## 🚀 Firestore Integration

### Storage Path
```
businesses/{businessId}/animal_groups/{groupId}
```

### Update with Merge
```dart
await db.collection('businesses')
    .doc(businessId)
    .collection('animal_groups')
    .doc(group.id)
    .set(group.toJson(), SetOptions(merge: true));
```

### Query Examples
```dart
// Get all animal groups for business
final groups = await agri.getAnimalGroupsForBusiness(businessId);

// Search by name
final results = agri.searchGroups('Layer Hens');

// Filter by type
final poultry = agri.filterGroupsByType('poultry');

// Get types in use
final types = agri.getAvailableGroupTypes();  // ['poultry', 'cattle']
```

## ✅ Compilation Status

All files pass Dart analyzer:
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ No null-safety violations
- ✅ No unused imports
- ✅ Type-safe implementations

## 📋 Testing Recommendations

### Before Deploy
1. **Manual Test:** Create group → Add feed record → Navigate detail → Verify history
2. **Search Test:** Create 5 groups → Search by name → Filter by type
3. **Offline Test:** Create offline → Add records → Go online → Verify Firestore sync
4. **Poultry Test:** Egg recording only shows for poultry groups
5. **Feed Calc:** Verify daily feed calculations match expected values

### Automation (if time permits)
```bash
# Run analyzer
flutter analyze

# Run tests (once test files created)
flutter test

# Build for target platform
flutter build apk --release   # Android
flutter build ios --release   # iOS
flutter build web --release   # Web
```

## 🎓 Architecture Notes

- **Clean Separation:** Model (livestock_group.dart) doesn't depend on UI
- **Provider Pattern:** AgriProvider handles all state + Firestore syncs
- **Master-Detail:** Dashboard list → Detail screen with full CRUD
- **Responsive UI:** Cards adapt to content, no fixed sizes causing overlaps
- **Backward Compat:** Old LivestockGroup references still work via typedef

---

## 📝 Known Limitations (Future Improvements)

1. No pagination for very large record lists (1000+ records)
2. No undo/restore for deleted groups
3. Age validation not strict (ageWeeks vs maturityWeek)
4. No bulk import for feed records
5. CSV export not implemented
6. Archive vs delete not distinguished

## 🔗 Related Features Still Pending

From original request, these are still TODO:
- [ ] Farm detail screen (similar pattern to animal_group_detail_screen)
- [ ] Crop detail screen (with tracking by season, yield)
- [ ] Quick navigation UI (buttons on dashboard)
- [ ] Task management (add tasks, track completion)

**These can follow the same architectural pattern as animal groups** — create model → create provider methods → create detail screen → update dashboard.
