## Cost Optimization Recommendations

1. **Firestore Optimization:**
   - Set up indexes for common queries
   - Implement query optimization
   - Consider data archiving for old transactions
   - Could save: $200-400/year

2. **Storage Optimization:**
   - Compress images before upload
   - Delete old/unused files
   - Implement lifecycle policies
   - Could save: $20-50/year

3. **WhatsApp Optimization:**
   - Use utility messages (₦4.30) instead of marketing (₦19.50)
   - Batch notifications where possible
   - Could save: $100-200/year

4. **Flutterwave Optimization:**
   - Encourage USSD payments (0.9% vs 1.4%)
   - No optimization possible here

5. **Consider Alternatives:**
   - Stripe: Similar pricing, possibly better rates
   - AWS instead of Firebase: Complex but potentially cheaper at scale
   - Local email server: Already implemented
