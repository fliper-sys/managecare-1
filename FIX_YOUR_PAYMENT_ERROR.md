# Your Flutterwave Payment Error Analysis

## Current Issue (Based on Your Logs)

Your logs show:
```
Status: error
Success: false
transaction_id: null
tx_ref: SUB_wViFOh98fbZTIGAx325BGyumlVC2_1765126346367
```

**Critical Finding:** `transaction_id: null` means Flutterwave **never started** processing the payment.

### What This Means

This error indicates **one of these issues:**

1. ✗ **Test Mode Mismatch** - Your key says `FLWPUBK_TEST` but the SDK is running in LIVE mode
2. ✗ **Invalid Firestore Key** - The key in Firestore doesn't match what Flutterwave expects
3. ✗ **Account Issue** - Your Flutterwave test account isn't properly configured
4. ✗ **Key Not Found** - Firestore key fetch failed (but logs say it succeeded)

---

## Step 1: Run the Diagnostics Tool (NEW!)

Now you have a **"Diagnose Payment Issues"** button on the payment screen:

### How to Use:
1. Open the app
2. Go to **Subscription Payment Screen**
3. Tap the **blue "Diagnose Payment Issues"** button
4. A report will show:
   - ✓ If your Firestore credentials exist
   - ✓ If your key format is valid
   - ✓ Exactly what's wrong (if anything)

**Screenshot this report** - it will tell you exactly what to fix!

## Step 2: Check Your Firestore Key

**Manually verify in Firebase Console:**

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your "manage-care" project
3. Go to Firestore Database
4. Navigate to: `secure` → `secure` document
5. **Look at the `publicKey` field**

### What Should Be There:

**CORRECT Example:**
```
FLWPUBK_TEST-81241a6c8f7e9b3a2d5c4e1f0a9b8c7d6e
```

**INCORRECT Examples:**
```
FLWPUBK_TEST (too short - truncated)
FLWPUBK_TEST-81241a6c8f7... (truncated with dots)
FLWPUBK_TEST- (incomplete)
[empty] (missing entirely)
```

### If Your Key is Wrong:

1. Go to Flutterwave Dashboard: https://app.flutterwave.com
2. Click Settings → API Keys
3. Copy your **TEST PUBLIC KEY** (not Live)
4. Come back to Firestore
5. Edit the `publicKey` field
6. **Paste the FULL key** (entire string, no truncation)
7. Save
8. **Restart the app**

## Step 3: Enhanced Logging Now Includes

The logs now show much more detail:

### New Log Section: TEST MODE DETECTION
```
[FlutterwavePaymentService] 🔍 TEST MODE DETECTION:
[FlutterwavePaymentService]   Public Key: FLWPUBK_TEST-...
[FlutterwavePaymentService]   Contains "TEST": true
[FlutterwavePaymentService]   Is Test Mode: true
```

**What to look for:**
- If `Contains "TEST": true` but `Is Test Mode: false` → There's a bug
- If `Is Test Mode: true` → Good, continues to check if Firestore has correct key

### New Log Section: Initiation Details
```
[FlutterwaveLogger] Initiation Details:
  Public Key: FLWPUBK_TEST-81241a6...
  Currency: NGN
  Amount: 5000
  Email: user@example.com
  TxRef: SUB_wViFOh98fbZTIGAx325BGyumlVC2_1765126346367
  Test Mode: true
```

**What to check:**
- Amount should be your plan price
- Email should be your account email
- Test Mode should be `true` (if using test key)

## Step 4: Three Ways to Get Help

### Option A: Use the Diagnostics Button (Easiest)
1. Tap "Diagnose Payment Issues" button in app
2. Read what it says
3. Follow the recommendations
4. Done!

### Option B: Share Console Logs
```powershell
# Terminal 1
cd C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\mc
flutter run

# Terminal 2
cd C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\mc
flutter logs
```

**Then:**
1. Try payment
2. Copy ALL logs from Terminal 2
3. Paste them when asking for help

### Option C: Share Complete Debug Report
1. Tap "🔍 Debug Info" button in app
2. Screenshot the popup
3. Tap "Diagnose Payment Issues" button
4. Screenshot that popup too
5. Share both screenshots

## Step 5: What Changed in Your App

### New Logging Details Added:

**1. Test Mode Detection** - Logs exactly if test mode matches your key
**2. Full Response Logging** - Captures every detail from Flutterwave
**3. Exception Details** - If an error occurs, shows complete stack trace
**4. Diagnostics Tool** - Checks your Firestore credentials automatically
**5. Debug Buttons** - Three buttons now help diagnose issues:
   - 🔍 Debug Info (shows system info + network status)
   - Diagnose Payment Issues (checks Firestore + shows recommendations)

## Most Likely Fix

Based on your error showing `transaction_id: null`:

**99% chance:** Your Firestore key is **incomplete, truncated, or wrong**

### Do This Now:

1. **Tap "Diagnose Payment Issues"** button in the app
2. **Read the report** - it will tell you exactly what's wrong
3. **If it says "Key format invalid":**
   - Get correct key from Flutterwave: https://app.flutterwave.com/settings/api-keys
   - Copy ONLY the test key (starts with `FLWPUBK_TEST`)
   - Update Firestore document with the FULL key
   - Restart app
   - Try payment again

---

## Next Steps After Fixing

Once you fix the key:

1. **Restart the app completely**
   ```
   flutter clean
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Try payment again**

3. **Check logs for:**
   ```
   [FlutterwavePaymentService] Flutterwave instance created successfully
   [FlutterwavePaymentService] Initiating Flutterwave charge...
   [After a few seconds, you should see Flutterwave payment dialog in app]
   ```

4. **If dialog appears** → Great! Use test card: `4242424242424242`

---

## Test Card for Testing

When Flutterwave dialog appears:

**Test Card Details:**
- Card Number: `4242424242424242`
- Expiry: `09/32` (any future date)
- CVV: `123`
- Pin: `1234`

(Only works in test mode - requires `FLWPUBK_TEST` key)
