# 🔴 CRITICAL: Your Payment Key is WRONG

## The Problem

Your logs show:
```
Key starts with: FLWPUBK-a4bf8a735d2b...
Test Mode: false
```

**This is WRONG!** The key should be:
```
FLWPUBK_TEST-... (for testing)
OR
FLWPUBK_LIVE-... (for production)
```

### What's Wrong

- ❌ Uses hyphen `-` after FLWPUBK instead of underscore `_`
- ❌ Missing the `_TEST` or `_LIVE` part
- ❌ Only 42 characters (should be 50+)
- ❌ This is why Flutterwave returns `status: error`

## How to Fix (5 Steps - Takes 2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Correct Key from Flutterwave

1. Open: https://app.flutterwave.com
2. Login with your Flutterwave account
3. Click **Settings** (top right)
4. Click **API Keys**
5. You should see:
   ```
   TEST PUBLIC KEY: FLWPUBK_TEST-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   TEST SECRET KEY: FLWSK_TEST-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

**Copy the TEST PUBLIC KEY** (the entire string starting with `FLWPUBK_TEST-`)

### Step 2: Open Firebase Console

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your **"manage-care"** project
3. Click **Firestore Database** (left menu)

### Step 3: Find and Edit the Document

1. In Firestore, look for:
   - Collection: `secure`
   - Document: `secure`

2. Click to open the document

3. Find the field: `publicKey`

### Step 4: Replace with Correct Key

**Current (WRONG):**
```
FLWPUBK-a4bf8a735d2b...
```

**Replace with (CORRECT from Step 1):**
```
FLWPUBK_TEST-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Exact copy-paste:**
- Paste the ENTIRE key from Flutterwave
- Make sure there are NO spaces
- Make sure there are NO line breaks
- Verify it starts with `FLWPUBK_TEST-`

### Step 5: Restart the App and Test

1. Stop the app (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Run again:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```
3. Try payment again

## Verification Checklist

After updating Firestore:

- [ ] Key starts with `FLWPUBK_TEST-` (not `FLWPUBK-`)
- [ ] Key is 50+ characters long
- [ ] No spaces before or after the key
- [ ] Saved to Firestore (green checkmark)
- [ ] App has been restarted
- [ ] Ready to test payment

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **DON'T:** Copy only partial key
❌ **DON'T:** Copy with extra spaces
❌ **DON'T:** Use LIVE key before testing thoroughly
❌ **DON'T:** Forget to restart app after changing key
❌ **DON'T:** Copy SECRET key - use PUBLIC key!

## If You Still See Error After Fixing

1. **Double-check the key** in Firestore:
   - Does it start with `FLWPUBK_TEST-`?
   - Is it complete (50+ chars)?
   - No spaces or line breaks?

2. **Restart Flutterwave account:**
   - Login to Flutterwave dashboard
   - Check account status: Settings → Account
   - Confirm account is "Active"
   - Regenerate keys if needed: Settings → API Keys → Regenerate

3. **Check Internet:**
   - WiFi working?
   - Can access https://api.flutterwave.com?
   - No VPN blocking payment?

4. **Get New Keys (if regenerated):**
   - New keys might be available after regeneration
   - Copy the NEW keys to Firestore
   - Restart app and test
