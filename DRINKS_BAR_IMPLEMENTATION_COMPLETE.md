## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### State Management:
- Provider (ChangeNotifier) for DrinkProvider
- Local state (setState) for cart in POS
- Repository pattern for Firestore operations

### Database Operations:
```dart
// Create Order
Order createOrder(Order order) {
  orders.add(order);
  repository.saveOrder(order.toMap());
  updateStock(); // Reduce inventory
}

// Order Model
class Order {
  final String id;
  final List<OrderLine> lines; // drinkId, qty, price
  double total() { /*calculate*/ }
}
```

### Receipt Integration:
```dart
// ReceiptManager handles:
ReceiptManager.handlePostSale(context, saleMap)
  → ThermalPrinterService creates receipt
  → PostSaleActionSheet shows Print/Share/Email
```

### Image Caching:
```dart
CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: drink.imageUrl,
  fit: BoxFit.cover,
  placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator,
  errorWidget: fallback_widget,
)
```
