# Flutterwave Payment Integration - Setup Guide

## Production-Ready Implementation

Your Flutterwave payment system is now completely rebuilt and production-ready.

## Key Features

✅ **Reads from Firestore**: Automatically fetches `publicKey` from `secure/secure` document  
✅ **Clean Architecture**: New `FlutterwavePaymentService` with proper error handling  
✅ **Type-Safe**: Uses `PaymentResult` model for response handling  
✅ **Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging with `◆` markers  
✅ **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive try-catch with stack traces  
✅ **User Feedback**: SnackBar notifications for all states  

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Add Your Flutterwave Keys to Firestore

In Firebase Console:
1. Go to **Firestore Database**
2. Create collection: `secure`
3. Create document: `secure`
4. Add these fields:
   ```
   publicKey: "YOUR_FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY"
   secretKey: "YOUR_FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY"
   ```

### 2. Get Your Keys from Flutterwave

1. Visit [Flutterwave Dashboard](https://app.flutterwave.com)
2. Login to your account
3. Go to **Settings → API**
4. Copy your **Public Key** and **Secret Key**
5. Add them to Firestore as shown above

### 3. Implementation Details

**File Structure:**
```
lib/
├── services/
│   └── flutterwave_payment_service.dart    (NEW - Core payment logic)
└── presentation/auth/screens/
    └── subscription_payment_screen.dart    (Updated - Uses new service)
```

**Payment Flow:**
```
1. User selects plan
2. Clicks "Subscribe Now"
3. Button triggers _processPayment()
4. Service fetches public key from Firestore
5. Flutterwave dialog opens
6. User completes payment
7. Subscription updates in database
8. Success message shown
```

## API Reference

### FlutterwavePaymentService

```dart
final paymentService = FlutterwavePaymentService();

final result = await paymentService.processPayment(
  context: context,
  amount: 20000.0,
  currency: 'NGN',
  email: 'user@example.com',
  fullName: 'John Doe',
  transactionId: 'TXN_12345',
  phoneNumber: '08012345678', // Optional
);

if (result.success) {
  // Payment successful
  // Save transaction: result.transactionId
  // Access response: result.processorResponse
} else {
  // Payment failed
  // Show error: result.message
}
```

### PaymentResult Model

```dart
class PaymentResult {
  final bool success;               // Whether payment succeeded
  final String transactionId;       // Transaction reference
  final String message;             // User-friendly message
  final String status;              // 'completed', 'failed', 'error'
  final Map<String, dynamic>? processorResponse; // Raw Flutterwave response
}
```

## Testing

### Test Credentials
Use Flutterwave's test cards in test mode:
- **Card**: 5531 8866 5005 9960
- **Expiry**: 09/32
- **CVV**: 564

### Debug Logs
Look for these patterns in console:
```
[SubscriptionPaymentScreen] ◆ Payment flow started
[SubscriptionPaymentScreen] ▶ Initiating Flutterwave payment...
[FlutterwavePaymentService] Public key fetched from Firestore
[FlutterwavePaymentService] ✓ Payment successful
[SubscriptionPaymentScreen] ✓ Subscription activated successfully!
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Public key not found in Firestore"
**Solution**: Ensure you've added the `publicKey` field to `secure/secure` document

### Issue: "Payment gateway configuration not loaded"
**Solution**: Check Firestore security rules - app must have read access to `secure` collection

### Issue: "Payment failed"
**Solution**: 
1. Check if public key is valid
2. Ensure Flutterwave account is active
3. Verify amount is greater than 0
4. Check currency is supported

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Replace test public key with production key in Firestore
- [ ] Remove debug print statements if needed (or keep for monitoring)
- [ ] Test with real card on test account
- [ ] Verify subscription activation after payment
- [ ] Set up error notifications/logging
- [ ] Test on both Android and iOS
- [ ] Verify Firestore security rules
