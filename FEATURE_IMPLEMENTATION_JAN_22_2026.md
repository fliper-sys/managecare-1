## Feature 1: Low Stock Products Page

### File Created
**Location**: `lib/presentation/inventory/screens/low_stock_products_screen.dart`

### Functionality
- Displays all products with inventory below a configurable threshold
- Dynamic threshold adjustment via slider (1-100 units)
- Real-time filtering based on Firestore queries
- Color-coded stock status (critical: red, low: orange, normal: blue)

### Key Features

- **Refresh Functionality**: Manual refresh button to reload data
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Details displayed in organized 2-column grid
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and retry functionality
- **Empty State**: Positive confirmation when all products are in stock

### Data Query
```dart
// Firestore Query
products.where('quantity', isLessThanOrEqualTo: threshold)
        .orderBy('quantity', descriptionSortOrder: false)
```

### Stock Status Colors
- **Red (Critical)**: Quantity ≤ 0 (out of stock)

```

### After
```dart
Row(
  children: [
    IconButton(
      icon: const Icon(Icons.remove_circle_outline),
      onPressed: qty > 1 ? () { retail.removeFromCart(item); } : null,
    ),
    SizedBox(width: 40, child: Center(child: Text(qty.toString()))),
    IconButton(
      icon: const Icon(Icons.add_circle_outline),
      onPressed: () { retail.addToCart(item); },
    ),
  ],
)
```

### Features
- **Minus Button**:
  - Removes 1 unit from cart (disabled when qty = 1)

  - Disabled state (grayed out) when quantity cannot decrease

- **Quantity Display**:

### Layout
```

              [-]  Qty  [+]
```

### Behavior
- Real-time state updates via `setState()`
